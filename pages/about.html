                Hi, I'm Amanda! I'm 16 years old and I'm passionate about
                reading, technology and astronomy. I created this blog as a way
                to share my book reviews, my discoveries and learnings about the
                world of science and technology, as well as a little about my
                journey. I am an aerospace engineering enthusiast and I believe
                that knowledge can transform the world! Here you will find my
                opinions on books, some technology tips and, who knows, more
                about what's next in my academic future. I hope you enjoy
                following my writings!
